## Overview

This simple extension visualizes the code DOM objects defined in the active document. This extension is a for of the popular plugin that is available for:
* Sublime Text 3 - [Sublime CodeMap plugin](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/sublime-codemap/blob/master/README.md)
* Notepad++ - [Part of CS-Script.Npp plugin](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script.npp/blob/master/README.md)
* Visual Studio - [PyMap (python flavor extension)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OlegShilo.PyMap)

The extension functionality is straight forward. Just click the code map item and it will trigger the navigation to the document where the corresponding code element is defined in the document.

_Features_:
* Supported syntaxes:
  * **Assembly** -- added in this repository.
    Requires the installation of [x86 and x86_64 Assembly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=13xforever.language-x86-64-assembly)
    ```
    A vsix file has been generated in the release folder: codemap-1.16.2.vsix.
    The command to create the vsix file is: 
       vsce package (run sudo npm install -g vsce if not found)
    In VS Studio Code, click on View/Extensions and use the option "Install from VSIX..." and select the file.

Note, the latest releases of CodeMap place the plugin view in its own activitrybar:

## Adding custom mappers
The most intriguing feature is the possibility to extend the plugin to support new and even more exotic syntaxes. Read more about the technique in this [Wiki page](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/codemap.vscode/wiki/Adding-custom-mappers). 

If you create mapping rules or dedicated mapper and want to share it with others. Create a pull request or just log the corresponding issue on this project and I will consider including your mapper into the plugin package. 

## Limitations

* The main objective of this plugin is not to provide the most accurate CodeDOM (syntax tree)  presentation but rather to assist with the navigation to the most important points in your code. Thus the default mappers deliberately avoid high resolution code parsing (e.g. local variables).
