## 1.16.1 (15 May 2021)

## 1.16.0 (23 September 2020)

- Added support for TCS syntax
- Issue #44: Cannot create json setting for dedicated mapper
- Issue #43: Sorting
  Implemented items sorting `codemap.sortingEnabled`
- Added `SyntaxMapping.levelIndent: number;` to allow defining logical indent for otherwise non-indented items matching generic mapper definition (triggered #32)
  Generic mapper definition is extended with an extra value `levelIndent`. This value defines not physical but logical indent that is assigned to the matching item that is non-indented at otherwise at runtime. For the cases of mixed indented/non-indented syntax like yours, this value needs to match the indent of the main (indented) syntax. Thus if your Python used 4 spaces to define first level nesting should be `4`. And the second level - `8`.

## 1.15.0 (12 August 2020)

- Issue #41: Customizing the color of the squares in "Codemap explorer"

  You can use an additional format for icon allows specifying custom path:
  `path:<absolute path to svg icon file>`
  The path string can contain special token `{theme}` which is replaced at runtime with the word "dark" or "light". Depending on the VS theme.  

  ``` json
      "codemap.md": [
        {
            "pattern": "^(\\s*)### (.*)",
            "clear": "###",
            "prefix": "Â -",
            "icon": "path:E:\\icons\\VSCode\\codemap\\{theme}\\custom_level_a.svg"
